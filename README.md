# Jellyswitch Android

## AppSettings

This is a Turbolinks-powered iOS application. Replace images and metadata (found in `demoapp/src/main/res/values/app_settings.xml`) and deploy. At Jellyswitch, we found that using git branches was an effective way to manage many apps across versions and customers.
